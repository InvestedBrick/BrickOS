**Brick OS** is a work-in-progress 64-bit operating system created mainly for learning purposes. 

# Branches
The normal branch where I will be writing everything in C will be `main`

The branch `unstable` is mostly for testing and trying to write this in `Brick-Lang` (currently abandoned, may cross-compile it one day)


# Building

## Dependancies
This project depends on you having installed the following binaries yourself:

- `qemu-system-x86_64`
- `qemu-img` 
- `make`
- `nasm` 
- `clang`
- `llvm-objcopy`

## Compilation && Running
You can simply run `make run` to compile and start the OS. 

# Notice
This project is still highly in development and kinda unstable, so things are not unlikely to break.
